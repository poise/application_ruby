Description
===========

This cookbook is designed to be able to describe and deploy Ruby web applications. Currently supported:

* Ruby on Rails
* Apache 2 with Passenger
* Unicorn
* Memcached client

Note that this cookbook provides the Ruby-specific bindings for the `application` cookbook; you will find general documentation in that cookbook.

Other application stacks may be supported at a later date.

Requirements
============

Chef 0.10.0 or higher required (for Chef environment use).

The following Opscode cookbooks are dependencies:

* application
* apache2
* passenger_apache2
* runit
* unicorn

Resources/Providers
==========

The LWRPs provided by this cookbook are not meant to be used by themselves; make sure you are familiar with the `application` cookbook before proceeding.

rails
------

The `rails` sub-resource LWRP deals with deploying Ruby on Rails webapps from an SCM repository. It uses the `deploy_revision` LWRP to perform the bulk of its tasks, and many concepts and parameters map directly to it. Check the documentation for `deploy_revision` for more information.

For applications that use Bundler, if a Gemfile.lock is present then gems will be installed with `bundle install --deployment`, which results in gems being installed inside the application directory.

When running Bundler, unnecessary groups will be skipped. The list of groups to skip is determined with this algorithm:

* start with this Array: `development test cucumber staging production`;
* the group corresponding to the current environment will be removed from the Array;
* if the `bundler_without_groups` attribute is set, those groups will be added to the Array.

For example, for a node running in the `production` Chef environment, and given:

    bundler_without_groups ["mysql"]

Bundler will be run with:

    bundle install --without development test cucumber staging mysql

# Attribute Parameters

- gems: an Array of gems to install
- bundler: if true, `bundler` will always be used; if false it will never be. Defaults to true if `gems` includes bundler
- bundle_command: The command to execute when calling bundler commands.  Useful for specifing alternate commands such as RVM wrappers.  Defaults to `bundle`.
- bundler_deployment: if true, Bundler will be run with the `--deployment` options. Defaults to true if a `Gemfile.lock` is present
- bundler\_without\_groups: an Array of additional Bundler groups to skip
- database\_master\_role: if a role name is provided, a Chef search will be run to find a node with than role in the same environment as the current role. If a node is found, its IP address will be used when rendering the `database.yml` file, but see the "Database block parameters" section below
- database\_template: the name of the template that will be rendered to create the `database.yml` file; if specified it will be looked up in the application cookbook. Defaults to "database.yml.erb" from this cookbook
- database: a block containing additional parameters for configuring the database connection
- precompile\_assets: if true, precompile assets for the Rails 3 asset pipeline. The default is nil, in which case we will try to autodetect whether the pipeline is in use by looking for `config/assets.yml`

# Database and memcached block parameters

The database and memcached blocks can accept any method, which will result in an entry being created in the `@database` and `@memcached_envs` Hashes which are passed to the respective templates. See Usage below for more information.

passenger\_apache2
------------------

The `passenger_apache2` sub-resource LWRP configures Apache 2 with Passenger to run the application.

# Attribute Parameters

- server\_aliases: an Array of server aliases
- webapp\_template: the template to render to create the virtual host configuration. Defaults to "#{application name}.conf.erb"
- params: an Hash of extra parameters that will be passed to the template

unicorn
-------

The `unicorn` sub-resource LWRP configures Unicorn to run the application.

# Attribute Parameters

- bundler: if true, Unicorn will be run with `bundle exec`; if false it will be installed and run from the default gem path. Defaults to inheriting this setting from the rails LWRP
- preload_app: passed to the `unicorn_config` LWRP
- worker_processes: passed to the `unicorn_config` LWRP
- before_fork: passed to the `unicorn_config` LWRP
- port: passed to the `unicorn_config` LWRP
- worker_timeout: passed to the `unicorn_config` LWRP

memcached
---------

The `memcached` sub-resource LWRP manages configuration for a Rails-compatible Memcached client.

# Attribute Parameters

- role: a Chef search will be run to find a node with than role in the same environment as the current node. If a node is found, its IP address will be used when rendering the `memcached.yml` file.
- options: a block containing additional parameters for configuring the memcached client

Usage
=====

A sample application that needs a database connection:

    application "redmine" do
      path "/usr/local/www/redmine"

      rails do 
        database do
          database "redmine"
          username "redmine"
          password "awesome_password"
        end
        database_master_role "redmine_database_master"
      end

      passenger_apache2 do
      end
    end

You can invoke any method on the database block:

    application "my-app" do
      path "..."
      repository "..."
      revision "..."

      rails do
        database_master_role "my-app_database_master"
        database do
          database 'name'
          quorum 2
          replicas %w[Huey Dewey Louie]
        end
      end
    end

The corresponding entries will be passed to the context template:

    <%= @database['quorum'] %>
    <%= @database['replicas'].join(',') %>

A sample application that connects to memcached:

    application "my-app" do
      path "..."
      repository "..."
      revision "..."

      memcached do
        role "memcached_master"
        options do
          ttl 1800
          memory 256
        end
      end
    end

This will generate a config/memcached.yml file:

    production:
      ttl: 1800
      memory: 256
      servers:
        - 192.168.0.10:11211
